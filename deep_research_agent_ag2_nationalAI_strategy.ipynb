        "* Write_File: This tool allows the agent to create and write data to files, which can be useful for storing information, generating reports, or persisting data between agent interactions.\n",
        "* Read_File: This tool complements Write_File by enabling the agent to read data from files. This allows the agent to access previously stored information or work with existing datasets.\n",
        "* Append_File: Extends the file manipulation capabilities by allowing the agent to add data to existing files without overwriting the original content. This is helpful for tasks like logging or building up data over time.\n",
        "* List_Files: Provides a way for the agent to retrieve a list of files in a specified directory. This helps the agent manage and access available files.\n",
