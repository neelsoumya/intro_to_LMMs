            "\n",
            "1. **Collaborative AI:**\n",
            "   AI is increasingly seen as a collaborative partner in various industries. In healthcare, AI assists in diagnostics by rapidly analyzing medical data, while doctors make the final decisions, blending AI's speed with human judgment and empathy. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. **AI for Public and Environmental Good:**\n",
            "   AI technology is applied in managing urban infrastructure more efficiently, reducing waste, and enhancing resource management. For example, smart traffic systems use AI to reduce congestion and emissions, showcasing AI's role in sustainable urban development.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Focus on Ethics and Privacy:**\n",
            "   There is an emphasis on developing AI with ethics in mind. This includes creating frameworks for accountability and transparency, and ensuring AI systems are free from bias. Organizations like the Partnership on AI and the International Association of Privacy Professionals often contribute to these discussions.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Economic Transformation and Workforce Development:**\n",
            "   Instead of replacing jobs, AI is viewed as a driver for economic growth and transformation. The focus is shifting towards reskilling programs and new job creation. Reports from bodies like MIT's Task Force on the Work of the Future provide insights into these changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Organizations and think tanks such as the AI Now Institute, IEEE, and governmental bodies provide more in-depth, authoritative studies and reports discussing these aspects. These sources are typically reliable for understanding the nuanced role of AI in today's world.\n",

            "   AI is designed to complement human abilities, enhancing productivity and allowing humans to focus on complex problem-solving tasks. In fields like medicine, AI tools assist in analyzing large datasets to find patterns that can lead to early diagnosis, while human professionals apply their expertise to interpret the results.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **AI for Sustainable Development:**\n",
            "   AI contributes to sustainability by optimizing natural resource use, improving energy efficiency, and supporting conservation efforts. For example, machine learning algorithms help in predicting weather patterns, which is crucial for disaster management and agricultural planning.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Ethical AI and Governance:**\n",
            "   Developing ethical AI involves creating systems that adhere to principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. Guidelines and policies from organizations such as the AI Ethics Lab encourage responsible AI deployments that respect user privacy and mitigate biases.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Economic and Workforce Innovation:**\n",
            "   AI is a catalyst for innovation within the economy by automating mundane tasks and allowing humans to focus on creative and analytical roles. Institutions are responding by advocating for education systems that prepare workers for AI-enhanced roles and new job categories that AI technology creates.\n",
            "\n",
            "For a more in-depth exploration, I recommend accessing research from reputable AI-focused organizations and academic journals, which often address these themes within their studies on AI’s broader impact. These insights are typically available from places like The World Economic Forum, UNESCO's AI and Education reports, and IEEE publications on AI ethics and application.\n",

            "### Safety Tips for Naples\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Stay Aware of Your Surroundings:**\n",
            "   - Always be mindful of your belongings, especially in crowded areas like public transport, busy streets, and tourist attractions. Pickpocketing can be common in such places.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Use Reputable Transport:**\n",
            "   - If using taxis, consider official ones marked with a taxi sign and a meter. Alternatively, use reliable ride-sharing apps.\n",
            "   - Validate tickets when using public transport and keep an eye on your belongings.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Avoid Flashy Displays of Wealth:**\n",
            "   - Try not to openly display valuable items like expensive jewelry or large sums of money. Keep cameras and phones secure and out of sight when not in use.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Stick to Well-Lit And Busy Areas:**\n",
            "   - At night, stick to well-lit roads and avoid low-traffic areas. Popular neighborhoods and central locales are typically the safest.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Secure Your Accommodation:**\n",
            "   - Choose well-reviewed accommodations with good security practices, such as safe boxes for valuables.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Be Cautious with Street Vendors:**\n",
            "   - Be aware of scams when dealing with street vendors or unsolicited offers for tours and goods.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Stay Informed:**\n",
            "   - Keep updated on local news for any issues that might affect your travel plans, such as strikes or demonstrations.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Emergency Numbers:**\n",
            "   - Keep a note of emergency contact numbers. In Italy, you can dial 112 for general emergencies, 113 for police, and 118 for medical assistance.\n",
            "\n",
            "By staying alert and following these tips, you can minimize risks and enjoy a relaxed and safe visit to Naples. Let me know if there's anything more specific you'd like to know!\n",

        "Available Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the available tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Search: Allows the agent to perform web searches using Google Search and retrieve relevant information from web pages. This tool is crucial for gathering data and answering questions that require external knowledge.\n",
        "* Browse_Website: Enables the agent to interact with websites by visiting specific URLs, extracting content, and navigating through web pages. This is useful for tasks like data scraping, web automation, and information retrieval.\n",
        "* Write_File: This tool allows the agent to create and write data to files, which can be useful for storing information, generating reports, or persisting data between agent interactions.\n",
        "* Read_File: This tool complements Write_File by enabling the agent to read data from files. This allows the agent to access previously stored information or work with existing datasets.\n",
        "* Append_File: Extends the file manipulation capabilities by allowing the agent to add data to existing files without overwriting the original content. This is helpful for tasks like logging or building up data over time.\n",
        "* List_Files: Provides a way for the agent to retrieve a list of files in a specified directory. This helps the agent manage and access available files.\n",
        "* Delete_File: Enables the agent to delete files, allowing for cleanup or removal of unnecessary data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessing Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "You can access these tools through the agent.tools attribute of your DeepResearchAgent instance. For example, to use the Search tool, you would include it in the tools argument when calling the agent.run method:\n",
